# Vanilla lit-html

This is a simple example about how to use [lit-html](https://lit-html.polymer-project.org/) in an extremely
raw/VanillaJS basic website in order to cut down on repetitive code, such as page navigation.

# Setup

```
npm install
```

# Run

```
npm run serve
```

Note that you cannot just access the `index.html` page directly without the `npm run serve`.  This is because, anytime you
have Javascript in your HTML you must actually serve the code via a server.  `serve` is just a really simple server, any type
of server would have worked the same.
